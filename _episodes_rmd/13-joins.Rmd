title: Joins and data in the wild
teaching: 30
exercises: 15
questions:
- "How can I change the format of dataframes?"
objectives:
- "To be understand the concepts of 'long' and 'wide' data formats and be able to convert between them with `tidyr`."
keypoints:
- "Use the `tidyr` package to change the layout of dataframes."
- "Use `gather()` to go from wide to long format."
- "Use `spread()` to go from long to wide format."

```{r, include=FALSE}
source("../bin/chunk-options.R")
library(tidyverse)
knitr_fig_path("13-")
# Silently load in the data so the rest of the lesson works
gapminder <- read_csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
```


```{r}
centroids <- read_csv("data/country_centroids_primary.csv")
```
Ah - it's not a CSV. This is why you should look at the data first.  Looks like it might be a tsv..
```{r}
centroids <- read_tsv("data/country_centroids_primary.csv")
```

Column spec looks reasonable - things we'd expect to be numbers are.  Things we'd expect to be character are

## Joining data

We can use `dplyr` to join data.    It looks like we should try and match the `SHORT_NAME` column of the centroids data to the `country` column of the gapminder data.

```{r}
gapcountries <- gapminder %>% select(country, year) %>% filter(year == 2007)

```

```{r}
testjoin <- gapcountries %>% full_join(centroids, by=c("country"="SHORT_NAME"))
```



```{r}
gapcent <- gapminder %>% inner_join(centroids, by=c("country"="SHORT_NAME"))
```

```{r}
 gapminder %>%
  inner_join(centroids, by=c("country"="SHORT_NAME")) %>%
  filter(year==2007) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=LONG, y=LAT, colour=lifeExp, size=pop)) + geom_point()
```


```{r}
# Olympic medal table?

library(rvest)

medal_page <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Summer_Olympics_medal_table") %>% 
  html_node(.headerSort:nth-child(2))

```
